### _Profile_

Fresh High-School graduate from Sagesse School in Jdeideh with a Lebanese Baccalaureate in General Sciences with an underlined emphasis on Mathematics and Physics. I am seeking to join a reputable higher-education institution that will provide me with a suitable learning environment and open up the horizons of knowledge in front of me to climb the stairs towards academic and/or industrial excellence. 

I have been highly engaged in both curricular and extra-curricular activities; of these latter, mostly leading student teams working on real-world robotics design and prototype implementation projects in the context of various inter-school competitions and bootcamps. I have particular interests in Computer Hardware, Software, Networking and Communications as well as in Computer and Network Security. In addition, ever since 2013, I joined and became highly committed and engaged in the Lebanese Scouts - Sagesse Group and have currently reached the position of Chief of Patrol responsible for a group of eight scout patrollers. In year 2020, I have joined the Notre-Dame University of Louaize in the Computer and Communications Engineering program.

Reliable, trustworthy, numerable and meticulous, I am able to work on my own initiative or cooperatively with a good team of honest, trustworthy and hardworking members willing to strive for the accomplishment of important tasks, projects and any other kind of work assigned to them. Following appropriate training, I am surely able to deal with reasonable (i.e. suitable for my age and expertise) administrative duties competently.
